You might have noticed that all of my personal projects have been deleted.

Well that was not by accident...

# I don't host my projects on Microsoft Github anymore

I decided to finally move my personal projects to 
[codeberg](https://codeberg.org/comcloudway) and 
[sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~comcloudway/).

You can find a full list of git hosting sites I'm using on [my website](https://ccw.icu)
