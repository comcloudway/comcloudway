You might have noticed that all of my personal projects have been deleted.

Well that was not by accident...

# I don't host my projects on Microsoft Github anymore

I decided to finally move my personal projects to 
[codeberg](https://codeberg.org/comcloudway) and 
[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/comcloudway)

Most of my personal projects can be found over on codeberg,
some ef them are being mirrored to gitlab, but my gitlab account is mostly being used for collaboration.

**NOTE**: The repos I've contributed to will stay here (as long as those projects continue using github)

## Why?
Just take a look at the title.

To quote ex-github user [Groctel](https://github.com/Groctel)
> I, as many others, don't trust that company and don't like the way they handle their products.
> After Microsoft made GitHub Copilot a paid proprietary tool that thanklessly fed on the work of hundreds of thousands of free software writers' work disregarding their licences and intellectual property rights, I decided to ditch yet another Microsoft product for good.
